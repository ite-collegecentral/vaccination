                <h1>Shortening the interval between 1st and 2nd Vaccination doses for ITE students</h1>
                <p>Dear Student,</p>
                <p>We thank you for participating in the vaccination exercise.</p>

                <p>MOH has announced on 29 June 2021 that the interval between the first and second vaccine doses can
                    be shortened to 4 weeks, and all individuals with scheduled second dose appointments 6 to 8 weeks
                    after their first dose appointment can now bring forward these appointments.
                </p>

                <p>For ITE students, the interval between the two doses will be brought forward to about 4 weeks.
                    Your Class Advisors will be communicating with you on the revised appointment date and timeslots for
                    your second dose. </p>

                <p>Let us continue to stand together in fighting this pandemic, and keep our institutions, our
                    community and our loved ones safe.</p>

                <p>Dr Ting Kok Guan</p>
                <p>Director / College Services / ITE College Central</p>
